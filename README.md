# Credit Risk Prediction using PyCaret AutoML

This tutorial demonstrates how to build and evaluate classification models for credit default prediction using PyCaret — a low-code machine learning library in Python. I used Home Credit Default Risk dataset from Kaggle to automatically train and compare multiple models, interpret results, and make predictions.

# Objective

- Predict whether a loan applicant will default (TARGET = 1) or not (TARGET = 0), using automated machine learning tools to:

- Preprocess the data

- Train and compare multiple classification models

- Select the best-performing model

- Interpret predictions and results

# Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

PyCaret (classification module)

Google Colab

Pandas

# Conclusion

This tutorial showed how AutoML simplifies model development and helps quickly identify strong baseline models. However, always evaluate results critically — especially for sensitive applications like credit scoring where recall and fairness are crucial.
